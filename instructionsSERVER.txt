notes: our server relies on file sharing in order to function
clients push their music files to the server when they request to add a song
to the queue. The server then saves it in ServerSongs which is wiped every
time the server is started in order to avoid redundant file names.

Every 5 seconds, clients ask the server for the number of songs in the queue
and what is the title of the first song in the queue. If a client finds that
they are missing a song, they send a request to the server. The server
then sends the filedata and queuedata, creating a mirror queue to the server's
queue. This allows us to still use player.run completely the same as before

To handle these new capabilities, we use two new executable files

BIG WORK IN PROGRESS, working on file sharing rn

NEEDED EXEC FILES: Server + AdderClient
These two programs talk to each other, AdderClient occationally calls adder in order to update its version of the queue

MVP 3 protocals in total all client to server
- Add this song
- Get that song
- Get Queue

Typical Use:
One person runs Server.run
Each person in the group share use AdderClient.run in order to talk to the
server.
Each person in the group uses Player.run in order to play the queue mirrored
from the server.
